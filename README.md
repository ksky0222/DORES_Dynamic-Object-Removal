# DORES(Dynamic_object_Removal_for_Effective_SLAM)

## why we need dynamic_object_removal?
While performing SLAM or Localization, robots may encounter various situations. 
For instance, there could be instances where dynamic objects are detected by sensors, or adverse weather conditions such as rain or snow causing interference with optical sensors like cameras or lidars. 
These situations involve objects other than map data being acquired by sensor data, which consequently leads to a decrease in accuracy in localization. 
Therefore, removing dynamic objects can enhance the accuracy of SLAM or Localization, and also improve the robot's perception capabilities in extreme conditions.
